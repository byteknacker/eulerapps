<div class="w-container home-container problem2-question">
    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
        <br>
        <br> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
        <br>
        <br>Extending from there, create an app that can take in an input field for the limit and output the sum of even-valued Fibonacci sequence.</p>
